`cloud-egress-ip-ranges` builds a normalized, classified dataset of cloud and edge network ranges for security engineering, traffic analysis, fraud controls, WAF policy, and data pipelines. It consumes official provider feeds, preserves source provenance, assigns an explicit confidence model, and publishes both machine-readable records and operationally convenient CIDR lists.

---

## Overview

Modern abuse and automation traffic often originates from disposable cloud infrastructure, managed compute, edge networks, CI systems, and serverless platforms. Provider-owned IP space is easy to identify at a broad level; exact workload attribution is not.

This project keeps that distinction explicit. It answers questions like:

- Which provider owns or publishes this CIDR?
- Is this cloud customer address space, an edge network, or a broad provider range?
- Could serverless or managed compute plausibly egress from this range?
- What action is reasonable for risk tooling: allow, monitor, rate limit, or challenge?
- Which source and precision level produced the classification?

The output is designed for systems that need deterministic data files, not a hosted dependency.

## Architecture

```text
official feeds / fixtures
        |
        v
provider parsers
  AWS, Google, Azure, Oracle, Cloudflare,
  Fastly, GitHub, GitLab, Atlassian, Stripe
        |
        v
normalized records
  schema + confidence + provenance
        |
        v
artifact builder
  JSON, CSV, manifest, classified lists
        |
        v
daily GitHub release assets
```

The builder has two execution modes:

| Mode | Purpose | Sources |
|---|---|---|
| Offline fixtures | CI, deterministic tests, local development | `tests/fixtures/` |
| Live build | Daily release artifacts | AWS, Google, Azure, Oracle, Cloudflare, Fastly, GitHub, GitLab, Atlassian, and Stripe official feeds/docs |

## Live Source Inventory

The release workflow generates `sources.md` on every build and uses it as the GitHub release body. The same inventory is also embedded in `manifest.json` under `source_catalog`.

| Provider | Feed | Source ID | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| AWS | AWS `ip-ranges.json` | `aws_ip_ranges_json` | cloud and AWS service ranges |
| Google Cloud | Google Cloud `cloud.json` | `google_cloud_json` | customer external IP ranges |
| Google | Google `goog.json` | `google_goog_json` | Google-owned provider ranges |
| Azure | Azure Public Service Tags JSON | `azure_service_tags_public_json` | service-tag and regional ranges |
| Oracle Cloud | Oracle OCI public IP ranges | `oracle_public_ip_ranges_json` | regional public cloud ranges |
| Cloudflare | Cloudflare IPv4 ranges | `cloudflare_ips_v4` | edge network ranges |
| Cloudflare | Cloudflare IPv6 ranges | `cloudflare_ips_v6` | edge network ranges |
| Fastly | Fastly public IP list | `fastly_public_ip_list` | edge/CDN and Compute possible ranges |
| GitHub | GitHub Meta API | `github_meta_api` | Actions, hooks, pages, API, git, and web ranges |
| GitLab | GitLab.com IP range docs | `gitlab_com_docs` | Web/API and webhook source ranges |
| Atlassian | Atlassian Cloud IP ranges | `atlassian_ip_ranges_json` | Atlassian Cloud egress ranges |
| Stripe | Stripe webhook IPs | `stripe_webhook_ips_json` | webhook source IPs |
| Stripe | Stripe API IPs | `stripe_api_ips_json` | API source IPs |

`provider-catalog.md` is generated beside the feed. It tracks all modeled provider tiers, including providers that are cataloged for ASN/BGP, docs scraping, customer-specific egress, or capability-only handling but are not emitted as CIDRs until a defensible source is implemented.

| `service_hint` | Provider service tag or project-level service hint |
| `serverless_possible` | Serverless or managed compute can plausibly use the range |
| `serverless_exact` | Exact serverless attribution; gated to owner/probe-confirmed sources |

See [docs/schema.md](docs/schema.md), [docs/confidence.md](docs/confidence.md), and [docs/outputs.md](docs/outputs.md).

<details>
<summary>Precision levels</summary>

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `L0` | Exact official service range |
| `L1` | Official provider range |
| `L2` | Serverless or managed compute possible |
| `L3` | Owner-confirmed egress |
| `L4` | Observed probe-confirmed egress |
| `L5` | Weak ASN/RDAP/WHOIS inference |

</details>

## Operational Notes

- Treat `recommended_action` as a policy hint, not a hard block decision.
- Prefer classified TXT lists for WAF, rate-limit, and enrichment pipelines that only need CIDRs.
- Use JSON records when provenance, confidence, and false-positive risk matter.
- Monitor `manifest.json` checksums, source counts, and `provider_catalog_coverage` across releases.
- Keep owner-confirmed ranges separate from broad official provider feeds.
- For live local builds, pass the current Azure Service Tags JSON URL:

```bash
uv run --python 3.12 python scripts/build.py --azure-service-tags-url "$AZURE_SERVICE_TAGS_URL"
```

## Project Scope

The project maintains a reproducible IP intelligence dataset and local tooling around that dataset. It does not require a daemon, database, web service, or account-level cloud telemetry. Public provider feeds are treated as provider/platform evidence; exact workload attribution requires owner-confirmed or observed data.

## Use Cases

- WAF and bot mitigation enrichment.
- Fraud and signup risk scoring.
- API abuse and scraping analysis.
- SIEM, warehouse, and log pipeline enrichment.
- Cloud/edge traffic segmentation.
- Research datasets for disposable compute and managed egress behavior.

## Limitations

Public cloud IP feeds do not identify the customer workload behind a request. NAT, BYOIP, proxying, private connectivity, and platform-specific egress configuration can change what appears on the wire. The dataset is best used as one signal in a broader risk model.

## Deployment

GitHub Actions is the deployment target for the dataset.

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | push, pull request | Compile, test, lint, offline build |
| `daily-release.yml` | daily cron, manual dispatch | Live build, release asset publication, Pages dashboard deploy |

The daily workflow resolves the current Azure Service Tags JSON URL, builds live artifacts, packages classified lists, and publishes stable release assets using the repository `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `contents: write`.

## Development

uv run --python 3.12 python -m compileall src tests scripts
uv run --python 3.12 python -m unittest discover -s tests
uv run --python 3.12 python scripts/lint.py
uv run --python 3.12 python scripts/build.py --offline-fixtures
