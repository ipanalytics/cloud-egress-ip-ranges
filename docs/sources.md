# Sources

The project uses official feeds as the default trust boundary.

## AWS

- Feed: `https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json`
- Source ID: `aws_ip_ranges_json`
- Useful fields: `ip_prefix`, `ipv6_prefix`, `region`, `service`, `network_border_group`

AWS ranges can show that traffic is from AWS address space or a published AWS service range. Public data does not prove exact Lambda origin for generic `AMAZON` or `EC2` ranges.

## Google

- Google-owned ranges: `https://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/goog.json`
- Google Cloud customer ranges: `https://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/cloud.json`
- Source IDs: `google_goog_json`, `google_cloud_json`
- Useful fields: `ipv4Prefix`, `ipv6Prefix`, `scope`

`cloud.json` is treated as customer Google Cloud resource space. Cloud Run or Cloud Functions can use configured VPC/NAT egress, so public ranges are classified as possible rather than exact.

## Azure

- Feed: Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags, Public Cloud JSON from Microsoft Download Center
- Source ID: `azure_service_tags_public_json`
- Useful fields: service tag `name`, `properties.region`, `properties.addressPrefixes`

Azure Service Tags identify Azure service and regional ranges. Exact Azure Functions attribution still requires app-owner data such as a specific Function App outbound IP list.

## Oracle Cloud

- Feed: `https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/public_ip_ranges.json`
- Source ID: `oracle_public_ip_ranges_json`
- Useful fields: `regions[].region`, `regions[].cidrs[].cidr`, `regions[].cidrs[].tags`

Oracle ranges are official OCI regional public IP ranges. Service tags are retained as hints, but exact workload attribution still requires customer or service-specific data.

## Cloudflare

- IPv4 list: `https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4`
- IPv6 list: `https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v6`
- Source IDs: `cloudflare_ips_v4`, `cloudflare_ips_v6`

Cloudflare ranges are official edge network ranges. Workers, CDN, proxy, WAF, and other edge products can use the network, so the feed marks edge/serverless as possible without claiming a specific product origin.

## Fastly

- Feed: `https://api.fastly.com/public-ip-list`
- Source ID: `fastly_public_ip_list`
- Useful fields: `addresses`, `ipv6_addresses`

Fastly ranges are official edge/CDN ranges. Compute@Edge is treated as possible from these ranges, not exact.

## GitHub

- Feed: `https://api.github.com/meta`
- Source ID: `github_meta_api`
- Useful fields: `actions`, `hooks`, `pages`, `api`, `git`, `web`

GitHub publishes platform ranges for Actions, webhooks, Pages, API, Git, and web traffic. These are emitted with service hints matching the Meta API groups.

## GitLab

- Feed: `https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_com/`
- Source ID: `gitlab_com_docs`
- Useful fields: documented GitLab.com CIDRs for Web/API and webhooks.

GitLab.com ranges are parsed from official documentation. They identify GitLab.com source ranges, not arbitrary self-managed GitLab installations.

## Atlassian

- Feed: `https://ip-ranges.atlassian.com/`
- Source ID: `atlassian_ip_ranges_json`
- Useful fields: `items[].cidr`, `items[].direction`, `items[].product`, `items[].region`

Atlassian Cloud ranges are filtered to records where `direction` includes `egress`. Product labels are retained as service hints for Bitbucket, Jira, Confluence, Rovo crawler, and related Atlassian services.

## Stripe

- Webhook feed: `https://stripe.com/files/ips/ips_webhooks.json`
- API feed: `https://stripe.com/files/ips/ips_api.json`
- Source IDs: `stripe_webhook_ips_json`, `stripe_api_ips_json`
- Useful fields: `WEBHOOKS`, `API`

Stripe publishes single IP addresses rather than CIDR blocks. The builder normalizes IPv4 addresses to `/32` records so downstream consumers can treat all outputs as CIDRs.

## Cataloged Providers Without CIDR Records

`provider-catalog.json` and `provider-catalog.md` retain the wider tier model: serverless/PaaS, edge/CDN, CI/CD, regional cloud, VPS/hosting, managed egress, SaaS webhooks, monitoring, and scanner sources.

Providers without a defensible CIDR feed are cataloged with a collection method such as `docs_scrape_or_asn_bgp`, `customer_specific_capability`, or `capability_only`. The generated range feed does not emit placeholder CIDRs for them.
